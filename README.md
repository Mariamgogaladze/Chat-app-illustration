# Challenge Details
For this challenge, I was tasked with creating a chat app design using HTML and CSS. I decided to create a mobile-first design, focusing on the user experience for mobile users. I created a custom illustration of a mobile phone for the header of the design, which sets the tone for the overall app design.

I used CSS to create the chat window and messages, I used CSS border properties and positioned them using flexbox. 
No images, SVGs or animations were used.



# Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
# Challenges and Learnings
This project was a great opportunity for me to practice my HTML and CSS skills, especially in terms of creating custom illustrations and using flexbox to position elements. 

Overall, I learned a lot about mobile-first design and responsive web design, as well as how to use CSS to create engaging user interfaces.
